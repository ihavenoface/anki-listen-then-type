Don't do it. It's a terrible idea.

Paste the contents of front.html, back.html and style.css to the respective fields. I was using this in conjunction with Core6k, so for other decks the inputs will vary.

There's a bunch of keybinds (most useful of which are peeking text, for when you really don't undestand the audio, or replaying the audio while on the textfield, since that would require dropping focus) on back.html. I'm sure you can figure them out.
